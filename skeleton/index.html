    <p>The purpose of this exercise is to learn the box model and start developing an ability to visualize the structure and organization of HTML elements on a web page. The focus should be on experimentation; think of the steps below as suggestions for what to experiment with. Every element in an HTML document is enclosed in a box, even those that don't look like boxes. A circular image, for example, will still be nested inside its own box when rendered to the page.

Update box_model.css as follows to see how different properties can affect these boxes.</p>
